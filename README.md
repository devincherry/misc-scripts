scripts
=======

This repo holds a collection of some quick-hack scripts I've written. This is just a dumping ground for some of my hacks (typically before it gets deleted or turned into a real project). While this is a public repo, and you may reuse any of these scripts as you see fit, I must warn that not all of these scripts work well and some may even break your systems. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
