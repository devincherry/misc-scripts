scripts
=======

This repo holds a collection of various scripts I've written over the years. This is intended to archive my prior work. And the scripts are generally intended for my own use. 

If you find these scripts useful, then you are welcome to use/modify them freely. However, I assume if you're using any of these scripts, you've done your due diligence and read the code to verify how it works. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
